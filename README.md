# Skiafy
Node.js script for converting SVG files to Skia Vector Icon files

**Note: ** This is a fork of https://github.com/zhsoft88/skiafy with much less
functionality. You probably want the non-forked version, which supports
optimization and processing directories. For my purposes I needed something as
minimal as possible.

## Installation

```sh
npm i github:fallaciousreasoning/skiafy
```

## Usage

```
Usage:
  skiafy [INPUT] [OUTPUT]

```

* With files:

  ```sh
  $ skiafy a.svg a.icon
  ```

  Output will output a skiafyed version of `a.svg` to `a.icon`
